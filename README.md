# parR
If a resistor value, (a [big] detailed value or one outside the E24 range) is needed, a solution is to place resistors in parallel or in series. This app examines both solutions.
Parallel resistors: All possible combinations of two and three resistors are inspected. The very best solution is presented. If unsuccessful, the app lowers the target value in one Ohm steps, down to -5%. If relevant, an extra series resistor is advised.
Series resistors: Three different algorithms are executed. It depends on the target value whether the outcomes differ or not. All calculated arrays are presented.
It is up to the end user to select his/her most appropriate outcome. In the rare case of little success, it may help to start with a somewhat (acceptable) higher target value.
