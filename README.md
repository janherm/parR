# parR
Calculates the best values of parallel/series resistors, to achieve a value outside the E24 range. 
Sometimes you need a resistor value outside the E24 range. When it's critical, for instance in filter design, you'll have to rely on parallel (or series) resistors. Often a time consuming task. This simple but straightforward utility calculates the very best solution for any target value, assuming one, or two resp. three resistors in parallel. To enhance the precision, an optional series resistor is advised. Nothing special, just a time saver.
